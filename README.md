#### Monash Real Estate (MonRE) is an agency run by Monash University, that helps individuals within the University’s community (such as the university’s staff and students) to find real estate properties around Australia. The management at MonRE frequently generates reports to keep track of the real estate property related information, e.g. calculating statistics of rents and sales automatically which can later be used for forecasting various trends and making predictions about the real estate.
#### At present, MonRE has an existing operational database which maintains and stores all of the real estate related information (such as rents, sales, properties etc.) required for the agency’s daily operation. However, since the staff at MonRE have limited database knowledge and the operational database is quite large, MonRE has decided to hire your team of Data Warehouse Engineers to design, develop and quickly generate reports from a Data Warehouse.<br><br>
